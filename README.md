# Music-Weekly
Project 2

USER STORY

AS A director of a challenge-based weekly music group,
I WANT to be able to run my group on a secure website that includes a database with a comment section.
SO THAT users can upload their files and their peers can give constructive feedback.

THE SIGN UP PAGE will consist of three separate boxes.
A link for current users to sign in
BOX ONE will be a username.
BOX TWO will be an email.
BOX THREE will be a password.

PAGE ONE will be the landing page.
AT THE TOP of the page will be the name of the organization, “MUSIC WEEKLY”. 
UNDERNEATH “Music Weekly” will be the following paragraph:

"Welcome to Music Weekly! 
The goal here is to complete one song a week, submit it here, and then provide feedback for your fellow musicians!
If one song a week is too strenuous, feel free to submit a song every other week - as long as you're consistent! The song doesn't have to be fully produced or the "standard" 3 - 4 minutes long. As long as you're submitting something by the end of the week, we're happy people! Feel free to set up your profile to let people know what type of music you write and what you hope to gain from this group!"

"We're all here to practice and have fun. This is a forum for constructive critique, learning, experimenting, and improvement.  "

"Feel free to comment any suggestions or ideas you might have as this is a group for the people! We want everyone to benefit from this as much as possible."

"If anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to reach out at heycmaia@gmail.com!"

"Good luck and happy music making!"

UNDERNEATH the welcome paragraph there will be five buttons.






THE BUTTONS will be labelled in order “WEEKLY PROMPTS”, “MAKE A SUGGESTION”, “MEET THE MEMBERS”, “MESSENGER”, “MY PROFILE”.

UNDERNEATH the buttons there will be a section available for anyone to make posts. 
YOU SHOULD be able to comment on these posts.
THE ADMIN (me) should be able to delete posts.

WHEN you click on the “WEEKLY PROMPTS” button, it will lead you to another page.
AT THE TOP of the page will be a title labelled “WEEKLY PROMPTS”.
UNDERNEATH the title will be a list of all of the weekly prompts, as “Song #: [insert song prompt here] in order from newest to oldest.
THE WEEKLY PROMPTS should be buttons that lead you to their individual page.

Each page will have links back to the other pages
